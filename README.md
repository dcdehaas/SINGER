# SINGER
SINGER stands for **S**ampling and **IN**ference of **GE**nealogies with **R**ecombination, and it is a Bayesian method to do posterior sampling of Ancestral Recombination Graph under Sequentially Markovian Coalescent. SINGER works by iterative threading one haplotype to the partially-built ARG, until the ARG for all haplotypes have been built. After initialization, MCMC will be performed to update the ARG to explore the posterior distribution. For a full description and cite our method, you can check: [Deng, Yun, Rasmus Nielsen, and Yun S. Song. "Robust and accurate bayesian inference of genome-wide genealogies for large samples." bioRxiv (2024): 2024-03.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.16.585351v1.supplementary-material)


Here we maintained the version which is under active development, but you can still direclty download the binary files for all past versions. 

[We are temporarily providing beta versions of it, the official versions will be released when the preprint has been accepted for publication. You are welcome to use it, and submit bug reports at GitHub Issues. ]

## Requirements

If you want to compile the source files, then C++17 and cmake are required. Otherwise you can also used the pre-compiled binary files on various platforms. 

## Installations

The easiser way is to directory go to the folder `releases/` and download one of the versions which work for your working platform (Linux/MacOS_Intel/MacOS_M1). After downloading, you can decompress it using:

```
tar -xvzf file_name
```

## Input and output

SINGER takes **.vcf** file and outputs a **.trees** file in tskit format. The mutations are already mapped to the branches, but non-polymorphic, multi-allelic sites and structral variants are excluded from inference. The branch length should be interpreted with units of generations, for example, for homo sapiens, you would need multiply that by 28 to convert to units of years. There will also be a **.log** file for you to check the argument you ran, and the summary statistic in MCMC iterations. 

## Basic usage

To sample ARGs with SINGER, you can run command line like shown below. 

**IMPORTANT!**:if you wish to get ARG for: **(1) a long chromosome or (2) a series of regions**, we have provided more support to help you (see the [next section: Tools](#Tools)). If you think there are other specific job pipeline which many people might want to use, please contact us and we might add it! 

```
path_to_singer/singer_master -Ne 1e4 -m 1.25e-8
-vcf prefix_of_vcf_file -output prefix_of_output_file
-start 0 -end 1e6
-n 100 -thin 20
```

This command is to get the ARG samples for a specific region in the vcf file. We specify the details of the arguments here (or you can simply type ```path_to_singer/singer_master``` to display similar information):

The required flags include (either `-m` or `-mut_map` has to be provided):

|flag|required?|details|  
|-------------------|-----|---|  
|**-m**|conditionally required|per base pair per generation mutation rate|
|**-mut_map**|conditionally required|name of the file describing the mutation rate landscape|
|**-vcf**|required|prefix of the input .vcf file name|
|**-output**|required|prefix of the output .trees file name| 
|**-start**|required|start position of the region| 
|**-end**|required|end position of the region| 

The optional flags include:

|flag|required?|details|  
|-------------------|-----|---|  
|**-Ne**|optional|the diploid effective population size, which means the haploid effective population size will be **2*Ne**|
|**-ratio**|optional|the ratio between recombination and mutation rate, default at 1|
|**-recomb_map**|optional|name of the file describing the recombination rate landscape|
|**-n**|optional|the number of posterior samples, default at 100|
|**-thin**|optional|the number of MCMC iterations between adjacent samples, default at 20|
|**-polar**|optional|the probability of correct polarization, default at 0.5 for unpolarized data, please use 0.99 for polarized data|

The output files will be:

```
prefix_of_output_files_nodes_{i}.txt, prefix_of_output_files_branches_{i}.txt, prefix_of_output_files_muts_{i}.txt, prefix_of_output_files_recombs_{i}.txt
```

with `i` from `0` to `num_samples - 1`. We recommend converting these files to tree sequence format in tskit, with this function:

```
path_to_singer/convert_to_tskit -input prefix_of_arg_files -output prefix_of_tskit_files
-start start_index -end end_index -step step_size
```

This tool will convert ARG sample with index from `start_index` to `end_index`, with interval size `step_size`. 


## Tools

### Running SINGER for a long chromosome

Often people would like to run the ARG inference method for the entire chromosome (or even the entire genome), and we have provided a python script `parallel_singer` to facilitate you to this end. It automatically handles parallelization for you and runs SINGER multi-threaded. 

```
parallel_singer -Ne 2e4 -m 1.2e-8 
```
This script will:

1. Cut the genome into windows (default at 1Mb)
2. Remove the windows of unsequenced regions (<5 variants in the window)
3. Automatically parallelize running SINGER on these windows
4. Convert the output to `.trees` files with `tskit` format


### Running SINGER for a series of regions

[this tool is still under development, and will be available soon]

Sometimes it is of interest to only look at certain regions on the genome (e.g. selection signals), and we have provided support for this with the python script `multiple_windows_singer.py`. It will automatically parallelize running SINGER on the regions you specify with a given `.bed` file. 

**Tips:** we recommend having windows not too small nor too big. A window containing 500-5000 SNPs would be ideal.

```
python multiple_windows_singer.py
```

This script will:

1. Index the vcf file for these specified windows
2. Automatically parallelize running SINGER on these windows
3. Convert the output to `.trees` files with `tskit` format

## Suggestions from developer

1. As a Bayesian sampling method, SINGER works best when you sample some ARGs from posterior, **only using one single sample is NOT ideal**. To this point, we highly encourage specifying **-n, -thin** flags. You can find how we run SINGER on real datasets on:
2. It is of importance to carefully choose the parameters, such as -Ne, -m, and -ratio. We recommend first choosing the mutation rate m, and then based on average pairwise diversity \($\pi=4\cdot N_e \cdot m\$), you can decide the Ne parameter. If you are not super sure about the recombination rate, you can use the default ratio of 1. 
3. Unfortunately for now we only support phased, high-quality genomes, and polymorphic sites with missingness will be excluded. We are working on incorporating missingness and unphased data in the near future. ARGweaver has better support in these regards.
